# Machine Config

My attempt at a clean machine.xml for the LumenPnP, created from scratch and containing only settings applicable to all machines. It is intended to be used in conjunction with OpenPnP's Issues & Solutions and allowes users to skip the Welcome, Connect, Basics and Kinematics milestones and start right off targeting the Vision and Calibration milestones. 

This is still incomplete and untested, use at your own risk. Feedback is highly appreciated.
